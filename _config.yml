  # Frequently asked questions.
  faq:
    - question: "What is a hackathon?"
      answer: >
        A hackathon is an invention marathon. Students come together to build cool
        software & hardware hacks over 24-48 hours. It's [very beginner friendly](https://medium.com/@tfogo/hackathons-are-for-beginners-77a9c9c0e000#.cj21niskl).
    - question: "How much does it cost?"
      answer: >
        Nothing. Attending a hackathon is free.
    - question: "Do I need to be a student to attend?"
      answer: >
        Yes. Only students who are currently enrolled at a college/university or
        have graduated within the past 12 months are eligible to attend.
    - question: "Will there be reimbursements for travel or shelter?"
      answer: >
        Unfortunately at this time we will not be providing reimbursements for travel or hotel. 
        Students coming from other cities will be required to make their own travel plans. There will be a designated nap room for part of the event for tired hackers.
    - question: "Where is the event?"
      answer: >
        The event is being hosted at the University of Calgary, in the ICT and Math Sciences Building.
    - question: "What if I don't have a team?"
      answer: >
        That's okay, you aren't the only one! Teams aren't officially formed until day-of, so you'll still have a chance to meet others and form a team!
    - question: "What is Major League Hacking?"
      answer: >
        Major League Hacking is [the official student hackathon league](https://mlh.io) in North America & Europe.
        We work with over 200 Member Events and empower over 70,000 students every year.
    - question: "Is there a code of conduct?"
      answer: >
        Yes there is. We enforce it very strongly. You can [find it here](https://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf).
